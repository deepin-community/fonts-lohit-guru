  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Qualify install and links file with the package name.
  * Introduce a udeb package to be used in the Debian Installer to get
    proper Punjabi rendering. Ship the fontconfig file directly under
    conf.d/ instead of conf.avail/ (the latter doesn't seem to exist in
    a netboot-gtk image). (Closes: #761570)

  [ Kartik Mistry ]
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no change).
  * Updated udeb description.
